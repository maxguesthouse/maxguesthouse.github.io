He helped guests find travel solutions when there were difficulties with train schedules 😀 There was a very friendly ambience amongst the staff and other travellers.

Helped with numerous issues: bus bookings, refunds, advice on safe areas in India, taxi arrangements getting the best price, lunch and breakfast, availability 24 hours a day for any question. Humble and accommodating. Truly trustworthy and one honest person in India! Travelling alone I came across a lot of scam and staying here felt like a safe sanctuary where common sense is healthy and person understands my needs, problems and worries. The host goes above and beyond for his guests equally. Treated all other guests as if they were his family members. Respect and gratitude for the host.”
